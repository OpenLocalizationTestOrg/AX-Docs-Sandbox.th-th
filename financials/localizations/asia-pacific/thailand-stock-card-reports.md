This topic provides information about stock card reports for legal entities in Thailand. A stock card report contains information about inventory movement, quantity, and cost for each item and warehouse, and must be generated when the government requests it. The stock card report is generated either before or after the inventory close process. 

You can generate the following stock card reports:

-   **Physical stock card** – View information that is related to one site or all sites, per location and warehouse, after packing slips are posted.
-   **Financial stock card** – View information that is related to one site or all sites, per location and warehouse, after invoices are posted.
-   **Stock card summary** – View item or warehouse details by item group, site, warehouse, and cost.
